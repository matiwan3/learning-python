Given a string, return a new string where the first and 
last chars have been exchanged.

# Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. 
# If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. 
# Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.

# front3('Java') → 'JavJavJav'
# front3('Chocolate') → 'ChoChoCho'
# front3('abc') → 'abcabcabc'

def front3(str):
  # Figure the end of the front
  front_end = 3
  if len(str) < front_end:
    front_end = len(str)
  front = str[:front_end]
  return front *3
